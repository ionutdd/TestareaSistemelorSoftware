# SCENARIOS

## Scenario 1: Quick Study with Personalized Quizzes  
Mirel, a student who aims to pass his courses with minimal effort, and Bursarescu, an ambitious student striving for top grades, both share the goal of efficiently preparing for their exams. However, they face different challenges that the existing system fails to address. Mirel struggles with large volumes of material that feel overwhelming, and he lacks the patience to read through everything. On the other hand, Bursarescu finds the standard quizzes insufficiently challenging for his advanced study goals. The current system does not offer customized quizzes based on individual needs, leaving both students feeling underprepared.

To overcome these challenges, the application’s AI-generated quizzes allow Mirel and Bursarescu to upload course PDFs and receive personalized 10-question quizzes. Mirel can quickly grasp key concepts without having to read the entire document, while Bursarescu can set higher difficulty levels for a more in-depth understanding. This system ensures that both students can prepare in a way that aligns with their specific study goals, offering a flexible solution to their different learning styles.

## Scenario 2: Feedback and Error Tracking  
Mirel, Bursarescu, and Schiorel, their professor, are all invested in improving student performance through real-time feedback. However, the current study tools available to Mirel and Bursarescu do not offer detailed insights into their mistakes, nor do they track areas where they consistently struggle. This lack of feedback makes it difficult for students to improve, and it also leaves Schiorel without a clear understanding of which concepts are challenging for his students.

In this scenario, the application’s feedback system addresses these gaps by providing instant, detailed responses after each quiz. For Mirel, this means learning from his mistakes without having to revisit entire chapters. For Bursarescu, the error tracking system allows him to focus on refining his understanding of specific weak points. Schiorel benefits from this as well, as he can access a dashboard that highlights common errors among students, enabling him to adjust his teaching methods accordingly. The integration of this feedback loop helps both students and professors identify areas of improvement quickly and effectively.

## Scenario 3: Collaborative Learning Rooms  
For students like Bursarescu, who seeks more interaction during the learning process, and Mirel, who enjoys socializing while studying, the lack of collaborative learning opportunities presents a significant problem. The current system does not provide a space for students to come together, share insights, and work through quizzes as a group. This isolation can hinder deep learning, especially for students like Bursarescu, who thrive in interactive environments.

The introduction of collaborative quiz rooms in the app solves this issue by creating virtual spaces where students can take quizzes together in real time. Mirel can now engage in a more enjoyable, peer-driven study session, while Bursarescu benefits from discussing complex topics with fellow high-achievers. Schiorel, the professor, can also monitor these interactions, gaining valuable insights into student collaboration and group learning dynamics. This feature creates a sense of community while also enhancing the learning experience through teamwork.

## Scenario 4: Sectional Quiz Generation from PDFs  
When Mirel faces large, overwhelming PDFs filled with information he doesn’t have the patience to sift through, and Bursarescu needs to focus on specific sections of his course material for interview preparation, they both encounter a major limitation in their study resources. Existing tools don’t break down lengthy content into smaller, manageable segments, leaving both students struggling to focus on the most relevant information.

With the app’s sectional quiz generation feature, these large PDFs are automatically divided into logical sections, each with its own set of targeted quiz questions. Mirel benefits from this by being able to concentrate on small, digestible chunks of material without feeling overwhelmed, while Bursarescu can zero in on the specific sections that are most relevant to his career goals. This feature provides a structured and efficient way for both students to study, ensuring they make the most of their time and effort.

## Scenario 5: Customizable Specialization-Based Quizzes  
Bursarescu, aiming to excel and prepare for future interviews, often finds that standard course quizzes lack the depth needed for specialized knowledge. Meanwhile, Schiorel, as a professor, desires a way to create quizzes adapted to the diverse needs of his students, particularly those pursuing different academic tracks or specializations. However, the current system’s rigidity doesn’t allow for the level of customization they both need.

The app’s specialization-based quiz feature solves this by enabling students like Bursarescu to select their area of focus—whether it’s data structures, algorithms, or another key subject—and receive quizzes specifically made for their learning path. Similarly, Schiorel can create quizzes that cater to different student levels or specializations, ensuring that every student gets the exact type of content they need. This level of customization ensures that both students and professors can adapt to the learning experience to meet individual goals and academic needs.

## Scenario 6: Secure API for Quiz Generation  
As the app grows in popularity, security becomes a key concern, especially for Admin and Schiorel, who are responsible for ensuring that only authorized users—such as registered students and faculty—can access the quiz generation system. The current system does not have the robust security measures required, potentially allowing unauthorized users to misuse the platform.

To address this issue, the app implements a secure API that only grants access to verified users. Admin ensures that the necessary authentication protocols, such as OAuth, are in place, while Schiorel and other professors have peace of mind knowing that the quiz system is protected. This not only maintains the integrity of the platform but also ensures that students like Mirel and Bursarescu can use it without encountering external disruptions.

## Scenario 7: Material References in Quizzes  
One of the ongoing frustrations for both Mirel and Bursarescu is the lack of easily accessible study resources. Mirel often finds himself lost when trying to learn more about certain topics, and Bursarescu, who needs additional references for deeper learning, has to search for material on his own. Schiorel, as their professor, would like to provide these resources directly within the quizzes, but the existing system does not allow for this level of integration.

With the introduction of material references in quizzes, both Mirel and Bursarescu can now see curated links or references within their quiz results. If they answer a question incorrectly, the app provides additional resources—such as articles or videos—that explain the concept in more detail. For Schiorel, this feature allows him to directly embed these resources into the quiz questions, ensuring that students have immediate access to further study materials. This seamless integration of learning resources enhances the depth of knowledge students can gain from each quiz.
